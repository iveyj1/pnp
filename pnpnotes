unpack and clean
    Extrusions have some burrs - remove with a flat file
    They also have cutting fluid residue - remove with mineral spirit/paint thinner
    Compare lengths of nominally identical extrusions on a flat surface - should be 
      well within 0.5mm of each other
Early: "m5x50" should be "m5x45" (no m5x50 provided)
Step 20 "20T synchronous wheel" should read "20T idler"
End  assemblies - ensure all 4 bracket ends are collinear with straight edge

Bearing was on the wrong side of rear bracket
Ensure one synchronous sprocket grub screw aligns with the flat on the stepper motor
Use m4x8 for the stepper motor mounting screws
Rear shaft bearing has a spherical mount - after shaft is partially inserted, the shaft should
be moved as necessary to allow the far end of the shaft to enter the motor adapter easily

circular nuts?
Remove the slides from the bag.  Wash down the rail and slides with mineral spirit  while moving slides, to remove the shipping grease.  When clean, wipe down with a clean rag and let dry.  When fully dry, apply a thin layer of white lithium grease to the rail, especially the side grooves, and work the slider back and forth.  

After installing y rails, check for parallelism, should be less than 0.5mm difference in width between front and back. 

Checking alignment
Set up test board so that x translation of full length of scale results in no visible shift
Check Y - move +50mm from scale origin, camera is over a point 0.2mm left of the y scale line
perpendicularity error :w
- 0.23 deg
